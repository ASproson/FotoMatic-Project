# FotoMatic Project
This was part of a Codecademy independent project where I had to make use of flexbox to layout the website according the initial design spec. I then went a step further and made the entire website responsive.

### Technologies
HTML and CSS written in Atom.

### Comments
Whilst the website is responsive I likely need to make some changes to the join waiting list button so that it scales proportionally to the viewport.
